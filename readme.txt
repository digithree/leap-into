LeapInto


LeapInto provides a simplified interface to the Leap Motion hand sensor input device. Multiple hand recognition is simplified to several stable categories and coordinates are normalised. The interface comes two flavours at present, an open broadcast system using the OSC protocol and a plugin for the Csound audio/music programming language.


I am still in the process of adding content to the repository so it is very incomplete at present. LeapIntoOSC should be working though.
